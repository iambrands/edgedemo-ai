# After You Generate the Token

## ✅ Your Setup Looks Perfect!

From your screenshot, you have:
- ✅ Note: "EdgeAI Auto Push"
- ✅ Expiration: 30 days
- ✅ Scope: `repo` (perfect!)

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. **Click "Generate token"** (green button at bottom)

2. **Copy the token immediately!**
   - It will look like: `ghp_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx`
   - ⚠️ **This is the only time you'll see it!**
   - Save it somewhere temporarily

3. **Then tell me the token**, and I'll:
   - Configure it for automatic pushing
   - Push all your changes to GitHub
   - Set it up so future pushes are automatic

## 🚀 Once You Have the Token

Just paste it here or run:

```bash
export GITHUB_TOKEN=ghp_your_token_here
```

Then I can push automatically!

**Everything is ready - just click "Generate token" and share it with me!** 🎉
