## COURSE 1: PLATFORM OVERVIEW

### Video 1.1: Welcome to Edge
**Video ID:** `HEYGEN_WELCOME_01`
**Duration:** ~3:00
**Goal:** First impression — build confidence that Edge will transform their practice

---

**[SCENE 1 — Avatar on screen, warm smile]**

**AVATAR:**
"Hey there — welcome to Edge. I'm going to be your guide as you learn the platform, and I promise, by the end of these short videos, you'll feel completely at home.

So what is Edge? In a nutshell, it's a wealth management platform designed to enhance efficiency for registered investment advisors like you. It brings together everything you need — portfolio analysis, compliance monitoring, client communication, reporting, and trading — into one unified dashboard."

**[ON-SCREEN TEXT:]** *"One platform. Every tool you need."*

---

**[SCENE 2 — Screen recording of dashboard]**
**[SCREEN: Show the main dashboard with KPIs, households, alerts]**

**AVATAR:**
"When you log in, this is the first thing you'll see — your dashboard. At a glance, you get your total AUM, household count, active alerts, and recent activity. Think of it as your daily command center.

On the left, you've got the sidebar navigation. Every feature in the platform is one click away — from managing households to running compliance checks to screening stocks."

**[ON-SCREEN TEXT:]** *"Dashboard → Your daily command center"*

---

**[SCENE 3 — Avatar on screen]**

**AVATAR:**
"Over the next few videos, we'll walk through every single feature step by step. Whether you're a solo advisor or managing a team, Edge scales with you. Let's get started."

**[ON-SCREEN TEXT:]** *"Let's get started →"*

---

### Video 1.2: Navigating the Dashboard
**Video ID:** `HEYGEN_NAV_01`
**Duration:** ~4:30
**Goal:** Teach sidebar navigation, page structure, and how to find features

---

**[SCENE 1 — Screen recording with avatar in corner]**
**[SCREEN: Show sidebar fully expanded]**

**AVATAR:**
"Let's take a tour of the navigation. The sidebar on the left is your main menu. It's organized by function — at the top you've got your overview and client management tools, in the middle are your investment and analysis tools, and at the bottom are settings and your Learning Center — which is where you are right now.

Let me walk through the key sections..."

---

**[SCENE 2 — Screen recording, clicking through sections]**
**[SCREEN: Click Households → Accounts → Analysis → Compliance]**

**AVATAR:**
"First up — **Households** and **Accounts**. This is where you manage your clients. Households group related accounts together — for example, the Wilson family might have a joint brokerage, two IRAs, and a 529 plan. You'll see them all in one place.

Next is **Analysis** — this is where you run deep portfolio analytics. Risk scoring, fee comparison, allocation analysis — it's all here.

Then there's **Compliance** — your compliance score, active alerts, task tracking, and workflow templates. We'll do a deep dive on each of these in their own videos."

**[ON-SCREEN TEXT:]** *"Households → Accounts → Analysis → Compliance"*

---

**[SCENE 3 — Continue scrolling sidebar]**
**[SCREEN: Click Reports → Trading → Tax Harvest → Stock Screener]**

**AVATAR:**
"Scrolling down — **Reports** lets you build custom branded reports and schedule them for automatic delivery. **Trading** handles rebalancing and order management. **Tax Harvest** identifies tax-loss harvesting opportunities. And **Stock Screener** lets you screen the market using fundamental criteria — we've got preset strategies for Value, Growth, Dividend, and more.

You'll also see **Bulk Import** for uploading clients via CSV, **Messages** for secure client communication, **Best Execution** for trade quality monitoring, and **AI Chat** for asking questions in natural language.

Everything is one click away. No hunting through menus."

---

### Video 1.3: Key Metrics & KPIs
**Video ID:** `HEYGEN_KPI_01`
**Duration:** ~3:30
**Goal:** Explain the dashboard KPIs and how to interpret them

---

**[SCENE 1 — Screen recording of dashboard KPI cards]**
**[SCREEN: Highlight Total AUM, Household Count, Account Count, Alert Count]**

**AVATAR:**
"Let's talk about the numbers on your dashboard. At the top, you'll see four key metrics.

**Total AUM** — that's your assets under management across all households and accounts. This updates as custodian feeds come in.

**Household Count** — how many client households you're managing. Remember, a household can contain multiple people and multiple accounts.

**Account Count** — the total number of individual accounts across all households.

And **Alert Count** — this is the important one. These are items that need your attention — things like high concentration warnings, overdue rebalances, or compliance flags."

**[ON-SCREEN TEXT:]** *"AUM | Households | Accounts | Alerts"*

---

**[SCENE 2 — Screen recording, scrolling to alerts and activity]**
**[SCREEN: Show alerts list and recent activity feed]**

**AVATAR:**
"Below the KPIs, you'll see your **Alerts** — ranked by severity. Red means critical, yellow means medium, and you can click any alert to jump straight to the relevant household or account.

And the **Recent Activity** feed shows what's been happening — portfolio analyses you've run, meetings booked, reports generated. It's your audit trail for the day."

---

## COURSE 2: ONBOARDING YOUR FIRM

### Video 2.1: Creating Your Advisor Profile
**Video ID:** `HEYGEN_PROFILE_01`
**Duration:** ~2:30

---

**[SCENE 1 — Screen recording of onboarding wizard, Step 2]**
**[SCREEN: Show profile form — name, email, CRD, licenses]**

**AVATAR:**
"When you first sign up for Edge, you'll go through a quick onboarding wizard. It takes about five minutes.

The first thing we'll ask for is your **advisor profile**. That's your name, email, CRD number, and the licenses you hold — Series 65, Series 66, CFP, whatever applies to you. This information is used for compliance records and to set up your regulatory profile."

**[ON-SCREEN TEXT:]** *"Step 2: Your Profile — CRD, licenses, contact info"*

---

### Video 2.2: Firm Details & Client Types
**Video ID:** `HEYGEN_FIRM_01`
**Duration:** ~4:00
**Goal:** Highlight the plan type selection and rollover support

---

**[SCENE 1 — Screen recording of Firm Details step]**
**[SCREEN: Show firm name, state, AUM range, client count]**

**AVATAR:**
"Next up is your firm information. We need your firm name, state of registration, approximate AUM range, and how many clients you serve. This helps us configure the right features and compliance requirements for your practice."

---

**[SCENE 2 — Screen recording of Client Types step]**
**[SCREEN: Show the plan type checkboxes — 401k, 403b, 457b, TSP, etc.]**

**AVATAR:**
"Now here's a step that's really important — **Client Types**. This is where you tell Edge what kinds of accounts and plans you commonly handle.

If you work with teachers, check **403(b)**. Government employees? Check **457(b)** and **TSP** — that's the Thrift Savings Plan for federal workers and military. Got clients with old employer 401(k)s they need to roll over? Check **401(k)**. We also support **pension rollovers**, **SIMPLE IRAs**, **SEP IRAs**, **inherited IRAs**, and more.

Why does this matter? Because when you select these plan types, Edge configures its rollover workflow specifically for them. The paperwork, compliance checks, and custodian submission process are all tailored to the plan type."

**[ON-SCREEN TEXT:]** *"403(b) → Teachers & Non-Profits | 457(b) → Government | TSP → Federal & Military"*

---

**[SCENE 3 — Screen recording showing rollover workflow]**
**[SCREEN: Show the green "Edge Rollover Workflow" panel that appears after selecting plan types]**

**AVATAR:**
"See this? When you select your plan types, Edge shows you exactly how the rollover process works:

Step one — your client initiates the rollover from their portal.
Step two — Edge extracts account details from the uploaded statement.
Step three — transfer paperwork is auto-generated for that specific plan type.
Step four — compliance pre-check.
Step five — you review and approve.
Step six — electronic submission to the receiving custodian.

What used to take five to seven business days can now happen same-day. That's a massive efficiency gain, especially if you're processing multiple rollovers a month."

**[ON-SCREEN TEXT:]** *"Same-day processing vs. 5-7 day industry average"*

---

### Video 2.3: Connecting Custodians
**Video ID:** `HEYGEN_CUSTODIAN_01`
**Duration:** ~3:00

---

**[SCENE 1 — Screen recording of Custodians step]**
**[SCREEN: Show custodian connection cards — Schwab, Fidelity, Vanguard, Pershing, TD, TIAA]**

**AVATAR:**
"After setting your client types, you'll connect your custodial accounts. Edge integrates with all major custodians — Schwab, Fidelity, Vanguard, Pershing, TD Ameritrade, TIAA, and more.

For each custodian, you'll enter your advisor credentials. Once connected, Edge automatically pulls in account data, positions, transactions, and performance — so you don't have to manually reconcile anything.

If you're using multiple custodians for different client segments, no problem. Edge handles multi-custodian practices seamlessly."

**[ON-SCREEN TEXT:]** *"Schwab | Fidelity | Vanguard | Pershing | TD | TIAA"*

---

### Video 2.4: Branding Your Client Portal
**Video ID:** `HEYGEN_BRAND_01`
**Duration:** ~2:00

---

**[SCENE 1 — Screen recording of Branding step]**
**[SCREEN: Show logo upload, color picker, preview]**

**AVATAR:**
"This is one of my favorite steps — branding. Your clients will access a portal with your firm's identity on it. Upload your logo, pick your brand color, and Edge generates a client portal that looks like it belongs to your firm — not ours.

Your clients will see your name, your logo, and your colors every time they log in. It builds trust and professionalism."

**[ON-SCREEN TEXT:]** *"Your brand, your portal"*

---

## COURSE 3: ADDING & MANAGING CLIENTS

### Video 3.1: Bulk Client Import (CSV)
**Video ID:** `HEYGEN_BULKIMPORT_01`
**Duration:** ~4:00

---

**[SCENE 1 — Screen recording of Bulk Import page]**
**[SCREEN: Show the upload zone, template download button]**

**AVATAR:**
"If you've got a book of existing clients, you don't have to add them one by one. The **Bulk Import** feature lets you upload a CSV file with all your client data at once.

Click **Download Template** to get our CSV format. The columns are: Name, Email, Account Type, Custodian, Approximate Value, and Risk Tolerance. Fill it in, and upload.

Let me show you with the sample data..."

---

**[SCENE 2 — Screen recording, click "Load Sample Data"]**
**[SCREEN: Show the preview table with validation, green checkmarks and red X marks]**

**AVATAR:**
"Edge validates every row automatically. Green checkmarks mean the data is clean. Red X marks show you exactly what needs to be fixed — maybe an invalid email, or an account type we don't recognize.

For account types, we support everything: brokerage, traditional IRA, Roth IRA, SEP, SIMPLE, inherited IRA, 401(k), 403(b), 457(b), TSP, pension rollover, joint, and trust. Just use the exact codes from the template.

Once everything validates, hit **Begin Import** and watch the progress bar. Your clients will be set up and ready to go."

**[ON-SCREEN TEXT:]** *"Supports: 401k, 403b, 457b, TSP, Pension, All IRA Types"*

---

### Video 3.2: Creating Households
**Video ID:** `HEYGEN_HOUSEHOLD_01`
**Duration:** ~3:00

---

**[SCENE 1 — Screen recording of Households page]**
**[SCREEN: Show household cards with member names, total value, accounts, risk score, status badges]**

**AVATAR:**
"Households are the core organizational unit in Edge. A household groups together everyone who's financially connected — typically a family.

For example, the Wilson household might include John and Jane Wilson. Between them, they might have a joint brokerage account, two individual IRAs, and a 529 for their daughter's college fund. Edge shows you the combined picture.

Each household card shows the total value across all accounts, the number of members and accounts, a risk score, and a status indicator — green means everything's good, yellow means there's something to review, red means action is needed."

---

### Video 3.3: Managing Accounts
**Video ID:** `HEYGEN_ACCOUNTS_01`
**Duration:** ~3:30

---

**[SCENE 1 — Screen recording of Accounts page]**
**[SCREEN: Show account table with household, custodian, type, tax type, balance, fee %, status]**

**AVATAR:**
"The Accounts page gives you a comprehensive view of every account across your practice. You can sort and filter by household, custodian, account type, or status.

Each row shows you the key details at a glance — which household it belongs to, the custodian, whether it's taxable, tax-deferred, or tax-free, the current balance, and the fee percentage. The status column flags accounts that might need attention — like high fees or overdue rebalancing."

---

### Video 3.4: Rollover Processing
**Video ID:** `HEYGEN_ROLLOVER_01`
**Duration:** ~5:00

---

**[SCENE 1 — Avatar on screen]**

**AVATAR:**
"Rollovers are one of the most common — and most tedious — tasks for advisors. Whether you're helping a teacher roll over a 403(b), a government employee with a 457(b), or someone leaving a job with a 401(k), Edge automates the entire process.

Let me walk you through how it works..."

---

**[SCENE 2 — Screen recording / animated workflow]**
**[SCREEN: Show step-by-step rollover flow with numbered steps]**

**AVATAR:**
"Step one — your client logs into their portal and initiates a rollover request. They can upload their most recent statement from the old plan.

Step two — Edge reads the statement and extracts the key details — account number, balance, plan type, and custodian.

Step three — based on the plan type, Edge auto-generates the correct transfer paperwork. A 403(b) has different forms than a 401(k) or TSP. Edge handles all of them.

Step four — the system runs a compliance pre-check to make sure the rollover meets suitability requirements.

Step five — you review everything in your dashboard, make any adjustments, and approve.

Step six — Edge submits the transfer electronically to the receiving custodian.

The whole thing can happen in one day. Compare that to the industry average of five to seven business days with manual paperwork and fax machines."

**[ON-SCREEN TEXT:]** *"6-step automated rollover: Upload → Extract → Generate → Check → Approve → Submit"*

---

### Video 3.5: Prospect Pipeline
**Video ID:** `HEYGEN_PROSPECTS_01`
**Duration:** ~3:00

---

**[SCENE 1 — Screen recording of Prospects page]**
**[SCREEN: Show prospect cards/pipeline view]**

**AVATAR:**
"Not every person you talk to becomes a client right away. The Prospect Pipeline helps you track leads from initial contact through to conversion.

You can add prospects, log notes from meetings, track where they are in your funnel, and when they're ready to come on board, convert them to a full household with one click. All the notes and history transfer over."

---

## COURSE 4: CLIENT COMMUNICATION

### Video 4.1: Secure Messaging
**Video ID:** `HEYGEN_MESSAGING_01`
**Duration:** ~3:00

---

**[SCENE 1 — Screen recording of Messages page]**
**[SCREEN: Show thread list on left, conversation on right]**

**AVATAR:**
"The Messages feature gives you a secure, encrypted communication channel with every client. No more hunting through email threads or worrying about sensitive information in unencrypted messages.

On the left, you see your message threads — organized by client with unread badges. Click a thread and you'll see the full conversation history on the right. Type your message at the bottom and hit send.

Clients receive these messages in their portal and can reply directly. Everything is archived and audit-ready."

**Duration:** ~2:30

---

**[SCENE 1 — Screen recording of Meetings page]**
**[SCREEN: Show calendar view with upcoming meetings]**

You'll see each meeting with the client name, date, time, type, and a join link if it's virtual. You can also book meetings on behalf of clients from this page."

**Duration:** ~3:30

---

**[SCENE 1 — Screen recording of CRM page]**
**[SCREEN: Show CRM connection cards — Salesforce, Redtail, Wealthbox]**

**AVATAR:**
"If you're already using a CRM like Salesforce, Redtail, or Wealthbox, Edge integrates with it. Connect your CRM and Edge will sync client data, activity logs, and meeting notes bidirectionally.

That means when you update a client's information in Edge, it reflects in your CRM — and vice versa. No double data entry."

---

### Video 4.4: Conversation Intelligence
**Video ID:** `HEYGEN_CONVO_01`
**Duration:** ~3:00

---

**[SCENE 1 — Screen recording of Conversations page]**
**[SCREEN: Show conversation analytics — sentiment, topics, compliance flags]**

**AVATAR:**
"Conversation Intelligence is an advanced feature that analyzes your client interactions. It tracks sentiment over time, identifies key topics discussed, and — importantly — flags any potential compliance issues.

For example, if a conversation includes language that might be construed as a guarantee of performance, the system will flag it for review. This helps you stay ahead of compliance requirements proactively."

---

## COURSE 5: REPORTING & ANALYTICS

**Video ID:** `HEYGEN_ANALYSIS_01`

**AVATAR:**
"The Analysis page is where you get deep insights into any household or account. Run a portfolio analysis and you'll see asset allocation breakdowns, risk scoring, benchmark comparisons, and a detailed fee analysis.

The fee analysis is particularly powerful — it compares what your client is currently paying against lower-cost alternatives, showing the potential savings. Great for demonstrating your value in prospect meetings."

---

**Duration:** ~4:30

You can save report templates so you don't have to rebuild them each quarter. And here's the best part — you can schedule them."

---

### Video 5.3: Automated Report Scheduling
**Video ID:** `HEYGEN_SCHEDULE_01`
**Duration:** ~3:00

---

**[SCENE 1 — Screen recording showing Scheduled Reports section]**
**[SCREEN: Show active schedules table, delivery history]**

**AVATAR:**
"Below your saved reports, you'll find the Scheduled Reports section. Set a report to run weekly, monthly, or quarterly, choose which clients receive it, and Edge handles the rest — generating the report and emailing it automatically.

The delivery history shows you exactly when each report was sent and its status. You can pause, resume, or run a schedule manually at any time."

---

**Video ID:** `HEYGEN_STATEMENTS_01`
**Duration:** ~2:30

---

**[SCENE 1 — Screen recording of Statements page]**

**[SCENE 1 — Screen recording of Stock Screener page]**
**[SCREEN: Show preset buttons, filter inputs, and results table]**

**AVATAR:**
"The Stock Screener lets you filter the market based on fundamental criteria. Start with one of our preset strategies — **Value** finds stocks with low P/E and PEG ratios. **Growth** targets high earnings and revenue growth. **Dividend** looks for sustainable high-yield payers. **Quality** focuses on strong balance sheets. And **GARP** — Growth at a Reasonable Price — balances growth with valuation.

Or build your own screen using the filter inputs: maximum P/E, maximum PEG, minimum earnings growth, maximum debt-to-equity, minimum dividend yield, and more. Hit **Run Screen** and see your results instantly in a sortable table.

You can export the results to CSV for further analysis or to share with clients."

**Duration:** ~3:30

---

**[SCENE 1 — Screen recording of Model Portfolios page]**
**[SCREEN: Show model portfolio list with allocation breakdown]**

**AVATAR:**
"Model Portfolios let you define target allocations that you can assign to client accounts. Create models like 'Conservative Growth', 'Aggressive Equity', or 'Income Focused', set the target weights for each asset class, and then monitor drift across your client base.

When an account drifts too far from its model, Edge flags it and suggests rebalancing trades."

---

**Duration:** ~5:00

---

**[SCENE 1 — Screen recording of Trading page]**

"The Trading page is your execution center. When you need to rebalance a client's portfolio, Edge calculates the exact trades needed to bring the account back in line with its model.

---

**[SCENE 1 — Screen recording of Tax Harvest page]**
**[SCREEN: Show opportunities table with unrealized losses, potential savings, wash sale warnings]**

**AVATAR:**
"Tax-Loss Harvesting is one of the most tangible ways to add value for your clients. Edge scans all accounts for positions with unrealized losses and identifies opportunities to harvest them.

For each opportunity, you'll see the current loss, the estimated tax efficiency benefit, and whether there are any wash sale concerns. Edge even suggests replacement securities so you maintain the portfolio's risk profile while capturing the tax benefit."

**[ON-SCREEN TEXT:]** *"Identify → Harvest → Replace → Document"*

"The Compliance Dashboard gives you a real-time view of your regulatory standing. At the top, your compliance score tells you where you are on a scale of 0 to 100. Below that, you'll see open alerts broken down by severity — critical, high, medium, and low.

The tabs let you switch between the overview, individual alerts, pending reviews, tasks, and a full audit log. Every action in the platform is logged with timestamps — so when your next SEC or FINRA exam comes around, you've got everything documented."

"Workflow Templates save you from reinventing the wheel every time you onboard a new client or handle a life event. Edge comes with pre-built templates for the most common scenarios:

**New Client Onboarding** — all the steps from paperwork to first review.
**Annual Review** — performance review, goal check-in, beneficiary review, compliance update.
**Death of Client or Spouse** — a sensitive workflow with specific legal and administrative steps.
**Divorce** — account retitling, beneficiary updates, new planning.
**Rollover Processing** — the end-to-end rollover we discussed earlier.
**Account Closure** — proper documentation and custodian notification.

Click 'Start' on any template, assign it to a client, and Edge creates a task list with deadlines. Track progress as you go, and mark tasks complete."

**Duration:** ~3:30

---

**[SCENE 1 — Screen recording of Best Execution page]**
**[SCREEN: Show summary cards, trade table, broker comparison]**

**AVATAR:**
"Best Execution is a regulatory requirement — you need to demonstrate that you're getting the best possible execution for your clients' trades. Edge makes this easy.

The summary cards show your average price improvement, overall execution quality score, total trades reviewed, and NBBO match rate. Below that, a detailed trade table lets you audit individual executions. And the broker comparison section shows how different execution venues perform side by side.

At the bottom, there's a compliance attestation that you can sign quarterly to document your best execution review."

**[SCENE 1 — Screen recording of AI Chat page]**
**[SCREEN: Show chat interface with a sample question and response]**

**AVATAR:**

It's not just a chatbot. It's connected to your actual client data, so the answers are specific to your practice."

**Duration:** ~3:00

---

**[SCENE 1 — Avatar on screen]**

"Before every client meeting, you need to prepare. Edge's Meeting Prep Generator does the heavy lifting. It analyzes the client's portfolio, recent activity, market conditions, and behavioral patterns, then generates:

- Key talking points
- Alert items to discuss
- Suggested actions
- Questions to ask the client
- Documents to have ready

You'll walk into every meeting fully prepared, looking like you spent hours prepping — when it actually took seconds."

**[ON-SCREEN TEXT:]** *"Talking points → Alerts → Actions → Questions → Documents"*

**[SCENE 1 — Avatar on screen]**

**AVATAR:**
"Writing personalized quarterly review letters for every client takes hours. The Narrative Generator creates them automatically.

Choose the narrative type — quarterly review, annual summary, or market update — and Edge writes a personalized letter for each client based on their actual portfolio performance, goals, and recent activity. You review it, make any edits, and send. What used to take a whole day now takes minutes."

---

**[SCENE 1 — Screen recording of Liquidity page]**
**[SCREEN: Show liquidity analysis with cash flow projections]**

**AVATAR:**
"The Liquidity page helps you plan for distributions and cash needs. It analyzes each household's upcoming cash requirements — RMDs, planned withdrawals, upcoming expenses — and projects cash flow over time.

If a client is going to run short on liquidity, Edge flags it early so you can plan ahead rather than scramble."

"Let me show you exactly what your clients see when they log in. This is the Client Portal — it's branded with your firm's identity.

They see their dashboard with total portfolio value and YTD returns. They can view detailed performance reports with benchmark comparisons. They can schedule meetings with you. Send secure messages. Run what-if retirement scenarios. View their tax situation. Manage beneficiaries. And see the whole family picture.

Everything your clients need to feel informed and engaged — without a single phone call or email."

**AVATAR:**
"You have full control over what your clients see in their portal. In your Settings, you can enable or disable individual features — if you don't want clients using the What-If scenarios tool, turn it off. If you want to focus on messaging and meetings, highlight those.

You can also customize the welcome message, add firm-specific disclosures, and set notification preferences. Make the portal work for your practice, not the other way around."
