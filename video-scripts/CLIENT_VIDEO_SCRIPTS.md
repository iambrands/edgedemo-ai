## COURSE 1: WELCOME TO YOUR PORTAL

### Video 1.1: Your Portal at a Glance
**Video ID:** `SYNTH_CLIENT_WELCOME_01`
**Duration:** ~2:30

---

**[SCENE 1 — Avatar on screen, warm greeting]**

**AVATAR:**
"Hi there! Welcome to your personal client portal. I'm going to walk you through everything you can do here — and I promise, it's really straightforward.

Your portal is a private, secure space where you can see how your investments are doing, communicate with your advisor, schedule meetings, and plan for the future. Think of it as your financial home base."

**[ON-SCREEN TEXT:]** *"Your financial home base"*

---

**[SCENE 2 — Screen recording of client dashboard]**
**[SCREEN: Show dashboard with total value, YTD return, accounts, quick action cards]**

**AVATAR:**
"When you first log in, you'll see your dashboard. Right at the top are the two numbers that matter most — your **total portfolio value** and your **year-to-date return**. That tells you how much you have and how it's performing.

Below that, you'll see your individual accounts — your IRA, brokerage, any 529 plans — each with its current value. And at the bottom, there are quick links to your most recent activity and any items that need your attention."

---

### Video 1.2: Navigating the Portal
**Video ID:** `SYNTH_CLIENT_NAV_01`
**Duration:** ~2:00

---

**[SCENE 1 — Screen recording showing navigation bar]**
**[SCREEN: Highlight each nav item with pointer]**

**AVATAR:**
"The navigation bar at the top takes you to every feature in your portal. Let me do a quick flyover:

**Dashboard** — your home page with the big-picture view.
**Performance** — detailed charts and returns.
**Goals** — your financial goals and progress.
**Documents** — statements and files from your advisor.
**Meetings** — schedule time with your advisor.
**Requests** — submit withdrawals, transfers, or other requests.
**AI Assistant** — ask questions and get instant answers.
**What-If** — run retirement and planning scenarios.
**Tax Center** — see your tax situation.
**Beneficiaries** — manage who inherits your accounts.
**Family** — see the whole household picture.
**Messages** — secure communication with your advisor.
**Learn** — that's where you are now — video tutorials for every feature.
**Settings** — update your profile and preferences.

Every feature is one click away. No hunting, no confusion."

**[ON-SCREEN TEXT:]** *"Everything is one click away"*

---

### Video 1.3: Setting Up Your Profile
**Video ID:** `SYNTH_CLIENT_PROFILE_01`
**Duration:** ~1:30

---

**[SCENE 1 — Screen recording of Settings page]**
**[SCREEN: Show profile section with name, email, phone, notification preferences]**

**AVATAR:**
"In Settings, you can update your contact information — email, phone number, and address. You can also set your notification preferences. Want email alerts when new documents are available? Turn them on. Prefer to just check the portal? You can turn notifications off.

This is also where you'll find your security settings — password changes and two-factor authentication."

---

## COURSE 2: UNDERSTANDING YOUR PERFORMANCE

### Video 2.1: Reading Your Dashboard
**Video ID:** `SYNTH_CLIENT_DASHBOARD_01`
**Duration:** ~3:00

---

**[SCENE 1 — Screen recording of dashboard]**
**[SCREEN: Highlight total value, YTD return, account cards]**

**AVATAR:**
"Let's break down what you're seeing on your dashboard.

The big number at the top is your **total portfolio value** — that's everything across all your accounts, combined. Next to it is your **year-to-date return** — that's how much your portfolio has grown since January 1st.

If the return is positive and green, your investments are up. If it's red, they're down. Remember, fluctuations are normal — what matters is the long-term trend.

Below, each account card shows the account name, type, and current balance. Click any account for more details."

**[ON-SCREEN TEXT:]** *"Total Value + YTD Return = Your financial snapshot"*

---

### Video 2.2: Performance Charts Explained
**Video ID:** `SYNTH_CLIENT_PERF_01`
**Duration:** ~3:30

---

**[SCENE 1 — Screen recording of Performance page]**
**[SCREEN: Show performance chart with benchmark line, time period buttons]**

**AVATAR:**
"The Performance page gives you a detailed view of how your money has grown over time. The blue line is your portfolio. The gray dotted line is your benchmark — that's a standard comparison point, typically a balanced index.

If your blue line is above the gray line, you're outperforming the benchmark. If it's below, the benchmark did better in that period.

You can change the time period — one month, three months, year to date, one year, or all time. Each view tells a different story. One month shows recent trends. All time shows the full journey."

---

**[SCENE 2 — Screen recording, scroll to monthly returns]**
**[SCREEN: Show monthly returns table]**

**AVATAR:**
"Below the chart, you'll see a month-by-month breakdown. This shows your return for each month compared to the benchmark. Some months will be up, some down — that's completely normal. What matters is the overall pattern."

**[ON-SCREEN TEXT:]** *"Blue = You | Gray = Benchmark"*

---

### Video 2.3: Asset Allocation
**Video ID:** `SYNTH_CLIENT_ALLOC_01`
**Duration:** ~2:30

---

**[SCENE 1 — Screen recording showing allocation chart]**
**[SCREEN: Show current allocation pie/bar chart alongside target allocation]**

**AVATAR:**
"Asset allocation is a fancy way of saying 'how your money is divided up.' You might have some in US stocks, some in bonds, some in international investments, and maybe a small portion in alternatives.

Your portal shows two views side by side — your **current allocation** (what you actually have) and your **target allocation** (what your advisor recommends). If they're close together, everything is balanced. If they've drifted apart, your advisor may suggest rebalancing — which just means adjusting things to get back to the target.

You don't need to do anything here — this is just for your visibility. Your advisor manages the rebalancing."

---

## COURSE 3: GOALS & FINANCIAL PLANNING

### Video 3.1: Setting Your Goals
**Video ID:** `SYNTH_CLIENT_GOALS_01`
**Duration:** ~2:30

---

**[SCENE 1 — Screen recording of Goals page]**
**[SCREEN: Show goal cards with progress bars — Retirement, College Fund, etc.]**

**AVATAR:**
"The Goals page is where you track what you're working toward. Each goal shows a progress bar — how close you are to your target.

For example, a retirement goal might show you're 65% of the way there. A college savings goal might show $45,000 out of a $100,000 target. These are living, breathing trackers that update as your investments grow.

If you want to add a new goal or adjust an existing one, you can submit a request to your advisor right from this page."

---

### Video 3.2: What-If Scenarios
**Video ID:** `SYNTH_CLIENT_WHATIF_01`
**Duration:** ~3:00

---

**[SCENE 1 — Screen recording of What-If page]**
**[SCREEN: Show scenario builder with retirement age, savings rate, projections]**

**AVATAR:**
"What-If is one of the most powerful tools in your portal. It lets you ask questions like:

'What if I retire at 62 instead of 65?'
'What if I increase my savings by $500 a month?'
'What if the market returns 6% instead of 8%?'

Adjust the sliders and see the projections change in real time. The tool shows you your estimated retirement balance, monthly income, and the probability of success for each scenario.

It's a great way to explore your options and have informed conversations with your advisor."

**[ON-SCREEN TEXT:]** *"Ask 'what if' → See the impact instantly"*

---

### Video 3.3: Risk Profile
**Video ID:** `SYNTH_CLIENT_RISK_01`
**Duration:** ~2:00

---

**[SCENE 1 — Screen recording of Risk Profile page]**
**[SCREEN: Show risk assessment results — score, category, description]**

**AVATAR:**
"Your Risk Profile reflects your comfort level with investment ups and downs. You may have answered a questionnaire when you first became a client — that's what determines your risk score.

Your profile might be conservative, moderate, moderately aggressive, or aggressive. This score helps your advisor choose the right investment mix for you.

If your circumstances change — say you get closer to retirement or receive an inheritance — let your advisor know so they can update your profile."

---

## COURSE 4: TAX CENTER & DOCUMENTS

### Video 4.1: Tax Summary Overview
**Video ID:** `SYNTH_CLIENT_TAX_01`
**Duration:** ~3:00

---

**[SCENE 1 — Screen recording of Tax Center page]**
**[SCREEN: Show realized gains/losses, estimated tax, harvesting opportunities]**

**AVATAR:**
"The Tax Center gives you visibility into the tax side of your investments. At the top, you'll see your **realized gains and losses** — that's from investments that were actually sold this year. Below that is your **estimated tax impact**.

One thing I love about this page is the **Tax Efficiency Opportunities** section. It shows you positions where your advisor might be able to sell at a loss to offset gains — that's called tax-loss harvesting. It's one of the best ways to keep more of your returns.

Remember, all of this is handled by your advisor. This page is just so you can see what's happening."

**[ON-SCREEN TEXT:]** *"Realized gains/losses → Estimated tax → Efficiency opportunities"*

---

Documents are organized by type and date. Click to preview or download. If you're looking for something specific, use the search bar at the top."

'How has my IRA performed this year?'
'What's my asset allocation?'
'Do I have any tax documents ready?'

The assistant gives you clear, easy-to-understand answers based on your actual account data. It's not generic advice — it's specific to you."

"When the AI answers your question, you'll see the key numbers highlighted in bold. Below the answer, you'll often see suggested follow-up questions — click any of them to dive deeper.

A few things to keep in mind: The AI is great for information and explanations, but for actual investment decisions or changes to your accounts, you'll want to talk to your advisor. The AI will tell you what the data says — your advisor provides the personalized recommendation.

If you're ever unsure about an answer, send a message to your advisor. They're always happy to clarify."

Each account shows when beneficiaries were last reviewed. If it's been a while, you'll see a yellow reminder to review them. Life changes — marriages, divorces, births, deaths — are all reasons to update your beneficiaries.

If you need to make a change, click **Request Update**. This sends a request to your advisor, who will process the change and confirm it with you. It's important to keep these current — outdated beneficiaries can cause serious complications for your family."
