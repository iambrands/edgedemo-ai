# Auto-Push Setup Complete

## ✅ What's Configured

Your repository is now set to use SSH for pushing:
- Remote URL: `git@github.com:iambrands/edgedemo-ai.git`

## 🔑 SSH Key Setup

If you haven't already, add your SSH key to GitHub:

**Your public key:**
```
[Check ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub]
```

**Steps:**
1. Go to: https://github.com/settings/keys
2. Click "New SSH key"
3. Title: "EdgeAI Demo"
4. Paste your public key
5. Click "Add SSH key"

## 🚀 Auto-Push Commands

Once SSH is set up, you can push automatically:

```bash
git push origin main
```

Or I can run it for you - just ask me to push!

## 🔄 Alternative: Personal Access Token

If SSH doesn't work, use a token:

1. Create token: https://github.com/settings/tokens
2. Select "repo" scope
3. Copy token
4. Run:
   ```bash
   git remote set-url origin https://YOUR_TOKEN@github.com/iambrands/edgedemo-ai.git
   ```

## ✅ Test It

```bash
git push origin main
```

If successful, you're all set for automatic pushing!
